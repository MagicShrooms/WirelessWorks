      <h1> Where it Started </h1>
      <p> In 1970, the University of Hawaii developed the first wireless network to wirelessly communicate data among the Hawaiian Islands. However, it wasn’t until 1991 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to discuss standardizing WLAN technologies. In 1997, the IEEE ratified the original 802.11 standard—the “802.11” technology term simply refers to Wi-Fi.</p>
      <p> In 1999 wireless was introduced to the general public as a “nice to have” with the 802.11 a and b ratifications. These standards had very low speeds (up to 54 Mbps & 11Mbps respectively) but it was ok, because there were no handheld mobile phones that utilized Wi-Fi and very few laptops.</p>
      <p> By 2003, however, some mobile devices that utilized Wi-Fi were coming out and portable laptops were becoming more standard for both business and personal use. That is when 802.11g was ratified— delivering up to 54 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz space. As we moved closer to today, in 2007, the birth of the smartphone really came about and along with it came the ratification of 802.11n. </p>
