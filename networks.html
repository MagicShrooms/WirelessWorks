      <h1> What is Bluetooth? </h1> <p> We're all use to wireless communication by now, even if we don't always realize it. Radio receivers and television sets pick up programs beamed in radio waves hundreds (possibly even thousands) of km/miles through the air. Cordless telephones use similar technologies to carry calls from a handset to a base station somewhere in your home. If you use Wi-Fi (wireless Internet), your computer sends and receives a steady stream of Internet data to and from a router that's probably wired directly to the Net. All these technologies involve sending information back and forth not along copper cables but in radio waves buzzing invisibly through the air.</p>
      <h1> Point-to-Point </h1>
      <p> Point-to-point (P2P) is a network topology used to create one-to-one (1:1) device communications. Bluetooth LE P2P topology is ideal for data transfers and well suited for connected device products, such as fitness trackers and health monitors. </p>
      <h1> Broadcast </h1>
      <p> Broadcast is a network topology that establishes one-to-many (1:m) device communications. Bluetooth LE broadcast topology optimizes localized information sharing, making it ideal for beacon solutions, such as point-of-interest (PoI) information and item and way-finding services. </p>
